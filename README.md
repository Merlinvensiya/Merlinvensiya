 The proposed work employed Gradient Boosting algorithms for
 regression and classification tasks. The Gradient Boosting
 Regressor was used to predict the yield and market price,
 while the Gradient Boosting Classifier was applied to
 determine the cancer prevention study findings. 
**AI-BASED HEALTH SPECTATOR APPLICATION**
 The system provides full-time assistance to the user by
 reporting his or her body condition and suggesting requisite
 remedies. The model can be put into production to generate
 disease predictions based on user inputs once it has been
 determined to be satisfactory. in predicting aforementioned
 diseases with an accuracy of 97.6%.
 **DENGUE PRONE AREA PREDICTION SYSTEM USING ML**
 This is a multi-class classification model based on random forest
 algorithm which detects dengue prone area more effectively.
 The results prove that the proposed system is more progressive
 by improvising in about 82.75 percent in accuracy, 85.7 percent
 in precision when compared with the existing system.

**PUBLICATIONS **
Research paper has been published in the journal of “data acquisition and processing (Vol. 38(1)
 2023).”
 TITLE: “early detection of dengue prone area using machine learning”
 PROJECT DESCRIPTION: the general objective of the research is to use few of the classifications
 techniques to determine the population of the dengue affected area
